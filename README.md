# Project2Rummy-master 
Rummy is a group of matching-card games notable for similar gameplay based on matching cards of the same rank or sequence and same suit. The basic goal in any form of rummy is to build melds which can be either sets (three or four of a kind of the same rank) or runs (three or more sequential cards of the same suit).

The program can be run with 2 arguments the first one is the number of AI controlled players. The second argument is -h if you want to activate the logger 
for example: if I set 0 all players will be non AI players

syntax : the_program_with_your_imports_nesesary.java (number of AI) (-h for logger)
